# CatFact 

This is simple coding challenge to illustrate how to use clean code architecture to develop simple apps. 
The app simply displays cats information including breeds. 


# Tech Stacks

- [Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)
  
    - [Material](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-material) - Build Jetpack Compose UIs with ready to use Material Design Components.
    - [Foundation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-foundation) - Write Jetpack Compose applications with ready to use building blocks and extend foundation to build your own design system pieces.
    - [UI](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-ui) - Fundamental components of compose UI needed to interact with the device, including layout, drawing, and input.
    - [Lifecycle-ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle) - Perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments.
    - [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) - Navigation in compose 
  
- [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)

    - [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx.html) - Provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack and Android platform APIs.
    - [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) - Major improvement to the original Android [Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index), which is no longer maintained.
    - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Designed to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way. The ViewModel class allows data to survive configuration changes such as screen rotations.
    - [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) - Provides an abstraction layer over SQLite used for offline data caching.

- [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Dependency Injection library.
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Type-safe http client and supports coroutines out of the box.
- [OkHttp-Logging-Interceptor](https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/master/okhttp-logging-interceptor/README.md) - Logs HTTP request and response data.
- [Flow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - Flows are built on top of coroutines and can provide multiple values. A flow is conceptually a stream of data that can be computed asynchronously.
- [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started/) - Build awesome beautiful UIs.
- [Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines) - Library Support for coroutines,provides runBlocking coroutine builder used in tests.

  
- [Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)

    - [Mockk](https://mockk.io/) - A modern Mockk library for UnitTest.
    - [Turbine](https://github.com/cashapp/turbine) - Turbine is a small testing library for kotlinx.coroutines Flow.
    - [Truth](https://github.com/google/truth) - Truth makes your test assertions and failure messages more readable.
    - [Flow Test](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/test) - Testing flows using Turbine 
    - [Compose UI Test](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/testing) - Test Ui compoents using sematics tree
